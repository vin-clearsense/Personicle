## Client Registration to Personicle

Client registration for access to personicle data.

- **Register your application**

  - Go to [Personicle client registration](https://personicle-client-registration.herokuapp.com/register) to register your app.

  - Fill in your application name, application uri (example:https://example.com), redirect uri (example: https://example.com/callback) and select the personicle scopes that your app needs access to. Click Register.
  
  - After successful registration, your **client id** and **client secret** will be generated. Make sure to make a note of it. You won't have access to them later.
